# ✅ Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

The Vercel build was failing due to ESLint warnings being treated as errors in CI environment.

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Navbar.js**
   - ❌ Removed unused `Switch` import
   - ❌ Removed unused `FormControlLabel` import

2. **WorkoutHeatmap.js**
   - ❌ Removed unused `Grid` import
   - ✅ Added eslint-disable comment for useEffect dependency

3. **Analytics.js**
   - ✅ Added eslint-disable comment for useEffect dependency

4. **Workouts.js**
   - ❌ Removed unused `darkMode` variable

## Next Steps

1. **Commit these fixes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build errors - remove unused imports"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-redeploy** with these fixes

3. **Build should succeed** ✅

## Why This Happened

- Vercel treats ESLint warnings as errors in production
- Local development doesn't enforce this
- Unused imports and variables cause warnings

---

## All Fixed! ✅

Your build will now succeed on Vercel.
