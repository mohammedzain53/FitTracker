## 🔍 Error Analysis

### Errors You're Seeing:

```
1. Script error
2. Error: translateDisabled
3. undefined is not an object (evaluating 'window.ethereum.selectedAddress')
```

---

## 🎯 What These Errors Mean

### 1. "Script error" (Multiple instances)
**What it is:** Generic browser error message  
**Cause:** Browser extensions or cross-origin scripts  
**Impact:** ❌ None - Your app works fine  
**Action:** ✅ Can be safely ignored

### 2. "Error: translateDisabled"
**What it is:** Browser translation feature conflict  
**Cause:** Mobile browser trying to translate the page  
**Impact:** ❌ None - Doesn't affect functionality  
**Action:** ✅ Can be safely ignored

### 3. "window.ethereum.selectedAddress"

**Cause:** MetaMask or similar crypto wallet extension  
**Impact:** ❌ None - Your app doesn't use crypto  
**Action:** ✅ Can be safely ignored

---

## 🛡️ Why These Errors Appear

### Browser Extensions
Mobile browsers (especially Chrome) have extensions that:
- Try to inject code into every page
- Look for crypto wallet connections
- Attempt to translate pages
- Monitor scripts

**These extensions cause errors when they don't find what they expect.**

### Cross-Origin Scripts
Some errors occur when:
- Browser tries to load external resources
- Ad blockers interfere
- Privacy settings block scripts

**These are browser security features working as intended.**

## ✅ How to Verify Your App is Working

### Quick Check:
1. ✅ Can you see the page?
2. ✅ Can you tap the hamburger menu [☰]?
3. ✅ Does the drawer open?
4. ✅ Can you navigate to different pages?
5. ✅ Can you interact with forms and buttons?

**If all YES → Your app is working perfectly!** 🎉

## 🧹 How to Clean Up Errors (Optional)

### Option 1: Disable Browser Extensions
```
Chrome Mobile:

2. Extensions
3. Disable all extensions
4. Refresh page
```

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Mode

Keep your mobile browser updated for best performance and fewer quirks.
