## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect from Phone?

**Check 1: Same WiFi Network**
- Phone and computer must be on the SAME WiFi
- Not mobile data, not different WiFi networks

**Check 2: Firewall Settings**
```bash
# Windows: Allow Node.js through firewall
# Go to: Windows Defender Firewall > Allow an app
# Find and check: Node.js
```

**Check 3: Verify IP Address**
Your server logs show:
```
Access from network: http://192.168.1.35:5000
```

If your IP changed, update `client/.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://YOUR_NEW_IP:5000
```

Then restart the dev server.

**Check 4: Test Backend Connection**
On your phone's browser, try:
```
http://192.168.1.35:5000/api/health
```

Should see: `{"message":"Fitness Tracker API is running!"}`

   - On phone, go to browser settings
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Refresh the page

2. **Hard Refresh**:
   - Pull down on the page to refresh
   - Or close and reopen the browser

3. **Check Screen Size**:
   - Menu button only shows on screens < 900px width
   - Try rotating phone to portrait mode

### Drawer Not Opening?

1. **Tap the ☰ icon** in the top-left corner
2. Make sure you're tapping the hamburger icon, not the logo
3. Try tapping slightly to the right of the icon
